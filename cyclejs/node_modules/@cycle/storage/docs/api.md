### <a id="storageDriver"></a> `storageDriver(request$)`

Storage Driver.

This is a localStorage and sessionStorage Driver for Cycle.js
apps. The driver is also a function, and it takes an Observable of requests
as input, and returns a **`responseCollection`** with functions that allow
reading from the storage objects. The functions on the
**`responseCollection`** return Observables of the storage data
that was requested.

**Requests**. The Observable of requests should emit objects.
These should be instructions to write to the desired Storage object.
Here are the `request` object properties:

- `target` *(String)*: type of storage, can be `local` or `session`,
defaults to `local`.
- `action` *(String)*: type of action, can be `setItem`, `removeItem` or
`clear`, defaults to `setItem`.
- `key` *(String)*: storage key.
- `value` *(String)*: storage value.

**responseCollection**. The **`responseCollection`** is an Object that
exposes functions to read from local- and sessionStorage.
```js
// Returns key of nth localStorage value.
responseCollection.local.getKey(n)
// Returns localStorage value of `key`.
responseCollection.local.getItem(key)
// Returns key of nth sessionStorage value.
responseCollection.session.getKey(n)
// Returns sessionStorage value of `key`.
responseCollection.session.getItem(key)
```

#### Arguments:

- `request$ :: Observable` - an Observable of write request objects.

#### Return:

*(Object)* the response collection containing functions for reading from storage.
